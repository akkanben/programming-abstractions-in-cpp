/* Programming Abstractions in C++
 *
 * Exercise 05-20 (actually a typo as 05-19 in the book and 05-21 is missing)
 *
 * Telephone numbers in the United States and Canada are organized into various
 * three-digit area codes. A single state or province will often have many area
 * codes, but a single area code will not cross a state boundary. This rule
 * makes it possible to list the geographical locations of each area code in a
 * data file. For this problem, assume that you have access to the file
 * AreaCodes.txt, which lists all the area codes paired with their locations as
 * illustrated by the first few lines of that file:
 *
 *  <image of AreaCodes.txt>
 *
 * Using the AirportCodes program as a model, write the code necessary to
 * read this file into a Map<int,string>, where the key is the area code and the
 * value is the location. Once youâ€™ve read in the data, write a main program
 * that repeatedly asks the user for an area code and then looks up the
 * corresponding location, as illustrated in the following sample run:
 *
 *  <image of sample run with area code>
 *
 * As the prompt suggests, however, your program should also allow users to
 * enter the name of a state or province and have the program list all the area
 * codes that serve that area, as illustrated by the following sample run:
 *
 *  <image of sample run with state name>

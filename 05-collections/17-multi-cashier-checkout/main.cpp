/* Programming Abstractions in C++
 *
 * Exercise 05-17
 *
 * As a second extension to the checkout-line simulation, change the program
 * from the previous exercise so that there is a single waiting line served by
 * multiple cashiersâ€”a practice that has become more common in recent years.
 * In each cycle of the simulation, any cashier that becomes idle serves the
 * next customer in the queue. If you compare the data produced by this exercise
 * and the preceding one, what can you say about the relative advantages of
 * these two strategies?

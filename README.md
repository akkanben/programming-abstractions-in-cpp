# Programming Abstractions in C++

## Exercises from the book "Programming Abstractions in C++" by Eric S Roberts (2012)

**Programming Abstractions in C++* has been the reader for Stanford CS106B since 2002.**

- Classic [YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE6E58F856038C69) with [Julie Zelinski](https://github.com/zelenski).
- More modern [2018 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoCMsyE1cvdWiqgyzwAz_uGLSHsuYZlMX) is also available on YouTube.
- The 2016 class website has a lot of [links](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1168/links.shtml) to previous years that can be bit difficult to Google. The course reader (*Programming Abstractions in C++*) can be easily obtained from most of the class sites.

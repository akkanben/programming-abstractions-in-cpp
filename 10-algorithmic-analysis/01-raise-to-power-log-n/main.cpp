/* Programming Abstractions in C++
 *
 * Exercise 10-01
 *
 * It is easy to write a recursive function
 *
 *  double raiseToPower(double x, int n)
 *
 * that calculates xn, by relying on the recursive insight that
 *
 *  x^n = x * x^nâ€“1
 *
 * Such a strategy leads to an implementation that runs in linear time. You can,
 * however, adopt a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy which takes advantage
 * of the fact that
 *
 * x^2n = x^n * x^n
 *
 * Use this fact to write a recursive version of raiseToPower that runs in
 * O(log N) time.

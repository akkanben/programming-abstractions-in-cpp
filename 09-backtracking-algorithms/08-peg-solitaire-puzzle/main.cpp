 * Exercise 09-08
 *
 * In theory, the recursive backtracking strategy described in this chapter
 * should be sufficient to solve most puzzles that involve performing a sequence
 * of moves looking for some solution. In practice, however, some of those
 * puzzles are too complex to solve in a reasonable amount of time. One puzzle
 * that is just at the limit of what recursive backtracking can accomplish
 * without using some additional cleverness is the peg solitaire puzzle, which
 * dates from the 17 th century. Peg solitaire is usually played on a board that
 * looks like this:
 *
 *  <image of peg solitaire board>
 *
 * The black dots in the diagram are pegs, which fill the board except for the
 * center hole. On a turn, you are allowed to jump over and remove a peg, as
 * illustrated in the following diagram, in which the colored peg jumps into the
 * vacant center hole and the peg in the middle is removed:
 * The object of the game is to perform a series of jumps that leaves only one
 * peg in the center hole. Write a program to solve this puzzle.

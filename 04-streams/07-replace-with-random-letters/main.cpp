/* Programming Abstractions in C++
 *
 * Exercise 04-07
 *
 * On occasion, publishers find it useful to evaluate layouts and stylistic
 * designs without being distracted by the actual words. To do so, they
 * sometimes typeset sample pages in such a way that all of the original letters
 * are replaced with random letters. The resulting text has the spacing and
 * punctuation structure of the original, but no longer conveys any meaning that
 * might get in the way of the design. The publishing term for text that has
 * been replaced in this way is greek, presumably after the old saying “It’s all
 * Greek to me,” which is itself adapted from a line from Julius Caesar.
 *
 * Write a program that reads characters from an input file and displays them
 * on the console after making the appropriate random substitutions. Your
 * program should replace every uppercase character in the input by a random
 * uppercase character and every lowercase character by a random lowercase
 * one. Nonalphabetic characters should remain unchanged. For example, if the
 * input file Troilus.txt contains the text from Troilus and Cressida,
 *
 *  <image of Troilus.txt snippet>
 *
 * your program should generate output that looks something like this:
 *
 *  <image of example run>

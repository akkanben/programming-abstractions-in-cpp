/* Programming Abstractions in C++

 * Exercise 03-09
 *
 * The waste of time in spelling imaginary sounds and their history
 * (or etymology as it is called) is monstrous in English . . .
 *    â€”George Bernard Shaw, 1941
 *
 * In the early part of the 20th century, there was considerable interest in
 * both England and the United States in simplifying the rules used for spelling
 * English words, which has always been a difficult proposition. One suggestion
 * advanced as part of this movement was to eliminate all doubled letters, so
 * that bookkeeper would be written as bokeper and committee would become
 * comite. Write a function removeDoubledLetters(str) that returns a new string
 * in which any duplicated characters in str have been replaced by a single
 * copy.

/* Programming Abstractions in C++
 *
 * Exercise 13-9
 *
 * For each of the three representations of the buffer given in this chapter,
 * implement the method
 *
 *  bool EditorBuffer::search(string str);
 *
 * When this method is called, it should start searching from the current cursor
 * position, looking for the next occurrence of the string str. If it finds it,
 * search should leave the cursor after the last character in str and return the
 * value true. If str does not occur between the cursor and the end of the
 * buffer, then search should leave the cursor unchanged and return false.
 *
 * To illustrate the operation of search, suppose that you have added the S
 * command to the editor.cpp program so that it calls the search method,
 * passing it the rest of the input line. Your program should then be able to
 * match the following sample run:

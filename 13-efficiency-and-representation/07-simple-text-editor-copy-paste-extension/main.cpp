/* Programming Abstractions in C++
 *
 * Exercise 13-07
 *
 * Most modern editors provide a facility that allows the user to copy a section
 * of the buffer text into an internal storage area and then paste it back in at
 * some other position. For each of the three representations of the buffer
 * given in this chapter, implement the method
 *
 *  void EditorBuffer::copy(int count);
 *
 * which stores a copy of the next count characters somewhere in the internal
 * structure for the buffer, and the method
 *
 *  void EditorBuffer::paste();
 *
 * which inserts those saved characters back into the buffer at the current
 * cursor position. Calling paste does not affect the saved text, which means
 * that you can insert multiple copies of the same text by calling paste more
 * than once.
 *
 * Test your implementation by adding the commands C and P to the editor
 * application for the copy and paste operations, respectively. The C command
 * should take a numeric argument to specify the number of characters using the
 * technique described in exercise 5.

/* Programming Abstractions in C++
 *
 * Exercise 13-02
 *
 * Even though the stacks in the two-stack implementation of the EditorBuffer
 * class (see Figures 13-6 and 13-7) expand dynamically, the amount of character
 * space required in the stacks is likely to be twice as large as that required
 * in the corresponding array implementation. The problem is that each stack
 * must be able to accommodate all the characters in the buffer. Suppose, for
 * example, that you are working with a buffer containing N characters. If
 * youâ€™re at the beginning of the buffer, those N characters are in the after
 * stack; if you move to the end of the buffer, those N characters move to the
 * before stack. As a result, each of the stacks must have a capacity of N
 * characters.
 *
 * You can reduce the storage requirement in the two-stack implementation of
 * the buffer by storing the two stacks at opposite ends of the same internal
 * array. The before stack starts at the beginning of the array, while the after
 * stack starts at the end. The two stacks then grow toward each other as
 * indicated by the arrows in the following diagram:
 *
 *  before --->         <--- after
 *
 * Reimplement the EditorBuffer class using this representation (which is, in
 * fact, the design strategy used in many editors today). Make sure that your
 * program continues to have the same computational efficiency as the two-stack
 * implementation in the text and that the buffer space expands dynamically as
 * needed.
 *
 * Solution 2021 Ben Mills
 *
 * The updated EditorBuffer files and the DoubleCharStack class implement the
 * exercise, this main file just tests it.

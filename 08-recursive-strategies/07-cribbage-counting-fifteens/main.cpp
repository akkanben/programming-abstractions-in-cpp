 * Exercise 08-07
 *
 * In the card game called Cribbage, part of the game consists of adding up the
 * score from a set of five playing cards. One of the components of the score is
 * the number of distinct card combinations whose values add up to 15, with aces
 * counting as 1 and all face cards (jacks, queens, and kings) counting as 10.
 * Consider, for example, the following cards:
 *
 * .-------.  .-------.  .-------.  .-------.  .-------.
 * | A     |  | 5     |  | 10    |  | 4     |  | 9     |
 * |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |
 * | diamo |  | clubs |  | spade |  | heart |  | clubs |
 * |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |
 * |     A |  |     5 |  |    10 |  |     4 |  |     9 |
 * '-------'  '-------'  '-------'  '-------'  '-------'
 *
 *
 * There are three different combinations that sum to 15, as follows:
 *
 * AD + 10S + 4H   AD + 5C + 9C    5C + 10S
 *
 * As a second example, the cards
 *
 * .-------.  .-------.  .-------.  .-------.  .-------.
 * | 5     |  | 5     |  | 5     |  | 5     |  | J     |
 * |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |
 * | clubs |  | diamo |  | heart |  | spade |  | clubs |
 * |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |  |       |
 * |     5 |  |    5  |  |     5 |  |     5 |  |     J |
 * '-------'  '-------'  '-------'  '-------'  '-------'
 *
 * contain the following eight different combinations that add up to 15:
 *
 * 5C + JC        5D + JC         5H + JC         5S + JC
 * 5C + 5D + 5H   5C + 5D + 5S    5C + 5H + 5S    5D + 5H + 5S
 *
 * Write a function
 *
 *  int countFifteens(Vector<Card> & cards);
 *
 * that takes a vector of Card values (as defined in Chapter 6, exercise 2) and
 * returns the number of ways you can make 15 from that set of cards. You donâ€™t
 * need to know much about the Card class to solve this problem. The only
 * thing you need is the getRank method, which returns the rank of the card as
 * an integer. You may assume that the card.h interface exports the constant
 * names ACE, JACK, QUEEN, and KING with the values 1, 11, 12, and 13,
 * respectively.
